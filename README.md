# üß† Python Development Journey

This repository documents my personal growth as a Python developer during college. It includes projects grouped by theme and complexity ‚Äî from beginner CLI scripts to automation, desktop apps, and API integrations.

While not all projects are perfect, each folder reflects what I was learning, struggling with, or refining. The goal is not just to show *what* I built ‚Äî but *how I learned*.
